In this project, our goal is to solve different types of problems given by different clients.
We will do it by opening a server that serves clients.
There are two types of servers:
1. Serial Server - accpet and handle one client each time.
2. Parallel Server - accpet and handle many clients parallelly.

Each problem will be solved by a solver which will be injected in the main.
Our program uses generic templates of problems and solutions. The user can choose which problem to send and configure in the main which solver to use.

In this homework, we were asked to deal with these problems:
1. string reversing - get a string and output the reversed string.
2. matrix minimum path - get a matrix with a cost for each cell, and output the path with the minimum cost.

For the first problem (string reversing), we implemented the string reverser solver.

For the second problem (matrix minimum path) we implemented 4 different search algorithms:
1. A-Star
2. Best First Search
3. Breadth First Search
4. Depth First Search

We have conducted an experiment to find which algorithm gives the best solution (finding the minimum path with the lowest complexity).
We did that experiment by giving each algorithm 10 matrices to solve, and we found that A-Star gave the minimum path with the lowest complexity each time,
so we chose to use A-Star in our program.

In order to run our program, you will need to run the main.cpp file, it will listen as a server on the port 5600,
then you will need to open a client, connect to the 5600 port, and send a matrix text file, line by line separated with '\n', each line composed by values of the matrix cells, separated with ',',
then give a cell to start from, and the goal cell. The last line needs to be 'end'.
A cell with the value '-1' is a "wall", that means the path can't go through it.
for example:

14,10,7,8
4,3,8,-1
2,0,23,4
11,6,3,18
0,0
3,3
end
